  The single owner of Apple developer credentials and certificates — checking
  what you have, explaining the types and why each is needed, creating the ones
  that can be created, and setting up auth credentials. Use this whenever the
  user needs a signing certificate (Apple Development / Apple Distribution /
  Developer ID / installer), asks which certificate they need or why, has no
  certificates and needs to create one, wants to export a certificate as .p12
  (e.g. for GitHub Actions / CI / another Mac), needs an app-specific password
  or a notary credential profile (notarytool store-credentials), or needs an App
  Store Connect API key. Other Apple skills (code-signing-provisioning,
  notarize-and-distribute, app-store-metadata, ship-apple-app) draw from this
  one for anything certificate/credential related.

# Apple Credentials & Certificates

This is the home for everything "identity material" in Apple development: the
**certificates** that sign your apps, and the **credentials** that authenticate
command-line tools to Apple. The goal is that the user understands *which* one
they need and *why*, has the right ones present, and can create what's missing.

Teach as you go — explain why a given certificate/credential is required, not
just the command. Other skills defer here, so be the authoritative, clear source.

## Two families (don't confuse them)
1. **Certificates** — cryptographic signing identities in your keychain (Apple
   Development, Apple Distribution, Developer ID Application, installer certs).
   They *sign* apps/installers.
2. **Auth credentials** — secrets that let CLI tools talk to Apple services
   without typing a 2FA code: an **app-specific password**, a **notary keychain
   profile** (built from one), and an **App Store Connect API key** (`.p8`).
   They *authenticate*, they don't sign.

## Workflow

### 1. Check what already exists
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/apple-credentials/scripts/apple_creds.py check
```
It lists signing certificates grouped by type, detects App Store Connect API
keys in the standard locations, notes notary-profile setup, and summarizes
what's present vs missing for each goal (development / App Store / Developer ID).

### 2. Identify what's needed for the goal
Map the user's goal to the right certificate using
[references/certificate-types.md](references/certificate-types.md) (the full
plain-language explanation of every type and *why* it exists):
- Run/debug on devices → **Apple Development**
- App Store / Mac App Store → **Apple Distribution** (+ **Mac Installer
  Distribution** for the MAS `.pkg`)
- Direct Mac distribution (DMG/notarized) → **Developer ID Application** (+
  **Developer ID Installer** for a `.pkg`)
And the right auth credential using
[references/auth-credentials.md](references/auth-credentials.md):
- Notarization (`notarytool`) → app-specific password → **notary keychain
  profile**, or an API key
- App Store uploads / fastlane / CI → **App Store Connect API key** (preferred)
  or app-specific password

### 3. Create / set up what's missing
- **A certificate is missing** → guide creation. Easiest: Xcode → Settings →
  Accounts → Manage Certificates → **+** → the type. Portal route + roles/limits
  are in [references/certificate-types.md](references/certificate-types.md).
  (Certificates aren't minted by a script here — Xcode/`fastlane match` do that
  properly, managing the private key; this skill guides and verifies.)
- **Export a certificate as `.p12`** (for GitHub Actions / CI / a second Mac) →
  follow [references/certificate-types.md](references/certificate-types.md#exporting-a-certificate-as-p12-for-ci--another-mac).
  This bundles the cert **and its private key** so another machine can sign.
- **A notary credential** → the skill creates the profile FOR the user after
  they supply an app-specific password (or an API key):
  ```bash
  NOTARY_PASSWORD='abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop' \
    python3 .../apple_creds.py store-creds --profile "MyNotary" \
    --apple-id "you@example.com" --team-id "ABCDE12345"
  # or, from an API key:
  python3 .../apple_creds.py store-creds --profile "MyNotary" \
    --key /path/AuthKey_XXX.p8 --key-id XXXXXXXXXX --issuer <uuid>
  ```
  Then tell the user they now have a reusable profile (`--keychain-profile
  MyNotary`) and won't re-enter the password.
- **An app-specific password or API key** → these are created by the USER on
  Apple's sites (only they can); run `setup` to print the exact steps, then use
  the result with `store-creds` or place the `.p8` per
  [references/auth-credentials.md](references/auth-credentials.md).

## What's safe vs ask-first
Safe: `check`, explaining, guiding creation, drafting commands. Ask first:
running `store-creds` (writes to the keychain), exporting a `.p12` (handles the
private key), and anything touching the Apple account.

## How other skills use this
`code-signing-provisioning` (signing model, profiles, errors), and
`notarize-and-distribute` / `app-store-metadata` / `ship-apple-app` defer here
for certificates and credentials. If this skill isn't installed, those skills
fall back to inline Xcode/`notarytool` guidance — but when it's present, it's the
single source of truth.

## Reference files
- [references/certificate-types.md](references/certificate-types.md) — every
  certificate type, why it exists, platform matrix, creation, roles/limits, and
  **`.p12` export for CI**.
- [references/auth-credentials.md](references/auth-credentials.md) —
  app-specific passwords, notary keychain profiles, and App Store Connect API
  keys: what each is, which tool needs which, and how to set them up.
- [scripts/apple_creds.py](scripts/apple_creds.py) — `check`, `store-creds`,
  `setup`.
