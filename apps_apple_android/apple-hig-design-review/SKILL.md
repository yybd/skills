description: >-
  Review a macOS or iOS app's UI against Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
  (HIG) and produce prioritized, actionable design/UX/accessibility
  recommendations. Use this whenever the user wants a design review, asks if
  their UI "feels native" or follows Apple's conventions, mentions the Human
  Interface Guidelines or HIG, wants to improve accessibility (VoiceOver,
  Dynamic Type, contrast), check Dark Mode / layout / typography / spacing /
  navigation patterns, or polish an app before shipping. This is advisory design
  guidance — it complements (does NOT replace) App Store Review Guidelines
  compliance, which is a separate concern handled by the
  app-store-review-compliance skill.

# Apple HIG Design Review

> **Conversational language:** talk to the user — questions, summaries, reports — in the `conversational language` set in the hub `DATA.md` (`~/Developer/app-hub/DATA.md`; currently `hebrew`); fall back to the language the user writes in if it is unset (e.g. a standalone project with no hub). This sets the *conversation* language only — content/deliverables follow the app's target locales.

Apple's Human Interface Guidelines describe what makes an app feel native, clear
and accessible on Apple platforms. Unlike the App Store *Review* Guidelines,
HIG conformance is rarely binary and rarely a rejection basis on its own — it's
a spectrum of quality. So this skill produces a **prioritized design review**
(what would most improve the experience), not a pass/fail verdict.

Be a thoughtful design reviewer, not a linter. Many HIG "rules" are defaults
with legitimate exceptions; a deliberate, well-executed choice that departs from
convention can be better than rote conformance. Explain the *why* behind each
recommendation (what the user gains) so the user can judge, and call out what's
already done well — a review that's all criticism is less useful and less
trusted.

The design knowledge lives in [references/hig-curated.md](references/hig-curated.md),
organized by topic with platform tags. Read it before reviewing.

## Scope

In scope: layout & spacing, navigation & information architecture, typography &
Dynamic Type, color & Dark Mode & contrast, controls & touch/click targets,
accessibility (VoiceOver, labels, traits, reduced motion), platform conventions
(iOS vs macOS idioms), feedback & state (loading/empty/error), iconography, and
adaptivity (size classes, window resizing, safe areas).

Out of scope (handled elsewhere): App Store *Review* Guidelines compliance
(privacy strings, IAP rules, demo mode, entitlements) → use the
`app-store-review-compliance` skill. App Store metadata/screenshots.

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the app and its surfaces
Identify platform(s) (iOS/macOS/both), the UI framework (SwiftUI, UIKit,
AppKit, or mixed), and the main screens/flows. Ask the user what the app is for
and who uses it if it isn't obvious — good design review is contextual, and a
pro tool, a kids' game, and a glanceable utility have different "right answers".

If a running app or screenshots are available, look at them — design is visual
and the code only tells part of the story. If not, review from the code.

### 2. Gather detectable signals
Run the scanner for the mechanical heuristics (framework, accessibility
modifier coverage, hardcoded font sizes vs text styles, hardcoded colors vs
semantic colors, Dark Mode signals, fixed frames):

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/apple-hig-design-review/scripts/scan_design.py <project-root>
```

It prints JSON. These are *heuristics*, not findings — e.g. a low ratio of
accessibility labels to interactive elements is a prompt to look, not proof of a
problem. Confirm by reading the code and (ideally) seeing the UI.

### 3. Review against the HIG topics
Read [references/hig-curated.md](references/hig-curated.md) and go topic by
topic. For each, judge how the app does and what would improve it most. Weight
accessibility highly — it's the area where code-level fixes have the clearest,
highest impact and where Apple's expectations are firmest (and it shades into
Review Guideline territory if egregious).

### 4. (Hybrid) Refresh against the live HIG when it matters
The curated reference has a `last-verified` date. If it's stale, the user wants
certainty, or the platform recently changed (new OS design language — e.g. a
new material/skin, new layout metrics), reconcile via
[references/refresh-from-web.md](references/refresh-from-web.md) and note any
drift.

### 5. Produce the prioritized review (template below)
### 6. Offer to apply the safe, mechanical fixes
Some recommendations are safe, local code changes (adding an
`.accessibilityLabel`, swapping a hardcoded font size for a text style, using a
semantic color). Offer to apply those. Anything that changes layout, flow, or
visual identity is a design decision — propose it, show the option, let the user
choose. Never silently restyle an app.

## Prioritization

Rank every recommendation by user impact, not by how easy it is to fix:
- **High** — meaningfully hurts usability or excludes users. Almost always
  accessibility (unlabeled controls, no Dynamic Type, fails contrast), broken
  adaptivity (clipped on small screens / not resizable on Mac), or a confusing
  navigation model.
- **Medium** — noticeably off-convention or inconsistent; erodes the "native"
  feel. Non-semantic colors that break Dark Mode, fixed type that ignores user
  text size, nonstandard controls where standard ones exist.
- **Low** — polish. Spacing/alignment nits, icon weight, minor copy.
- **Strengths** — what's already good. Always include this.

## Report structure

ALWAYS use this template:

```
# HIG Design Review — <app name>
Platform: <iOS / macOS / both>   UI framework: <SwiftUI / UIKit / AppKit / mixed>
HIG reference: curated digest (last-verified <date>)<, refreshed <date> if done>
Reviewed from: <code / screenshots / running app>

## Summary
<2-3 sentences: overall impression, the single highest-impact improvement, and what's done well.>

## ✅ Strengths
<bullets — concrete things the app does right>

## 🔴 High impact
### <topic> — <short title>
- Where: `path/file.swift:line` or <screen/flow name>
- Observation: <what you see>
- Why it matters: <what the user loses / who is excluded>
- Recommendation: <specific change>
- Effort: mechanical fix (offer to apply) / design change (needs your call)

## 🟠 Medium impact
<same shape>

## 🟡 Low impact / polish
<same shape>

## Mechanical fixes I can apply now
<list the safe local code changes; offer to do them>
```

Write "None found" under a heading rather than dropping it, so the user sees the
area was considered.
